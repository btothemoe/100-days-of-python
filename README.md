# 100-days-of-python

Repository to hold all of my Python projects in the 100 days of python course

## Description

This repository contains the Python code and projects I completed while working through Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python course on Udemy. The course covers a wide range of Python concepts, from basic syntax to more advanced topics like web scraping, API interaction, automation, and building games.

Each folder corresponds to a specific day or project from the course, with explanations and comments included in the code for better understanding.

Topics Covered:
Python Fundamentals
Functions and Loops
Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, etc.)
Object-Oriented Programming
File I/O
Web Development with Flask
Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy
APIs and Web Scraping
Automation and Scripting
Feel free to explore the projects, and I hope you find the solutions helpful!
